# 🧠 Text Embedding Exploration: NLP Embedding Project

Welcome to the **Embedding Project** – a practical and insightful project designed to explore the power of text embedding techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project demonstrates how raw text can be transformed into meaningful numerical vectors that machines can understand and process.  

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

This assignment is focused on comparing and implementing various **text embedding techniques** using a chosen dataset. The goal is to understand how to effectively represent textual data numerically and uncover semantic meaning through different methods.

## 🔍 Techniques Explored

| Embedding Method | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| 🧱 **Bag of Words (BoW)** | Represents text as a sparse matrix of word counts |
| 📊 **TF-IDF** | Weighs word importance based on frequency and document rarity |
| 🧠 **Word2Vec** | Captures semantic relationships using Skip-gram or CBOW |
| 🌐 **GloVe** | Learns embeddings based on global co-occurrence statistics |
| 🧬 **FastText** | Enhances embeddings by considering subword information |

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Process

1. **Data Preparation** 📦  
   - Load and clean the dataset  
   - Preprocess text: tokenization, stop-word removal, etc.  

2. **Embedding Implementation** 🧰  
   - Build BoW, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText models  
   - Analyze and compare the resulting vector representations  

3. **Evaluation & Insight Extraction** 📈  
   - Visualize embeddings  
   - Examine sparsity, similarity, and semantic accuracy
