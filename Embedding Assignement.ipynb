stephen king , featuring an outstanding , oscar-winning performance from kathy bates . \\ngeez , french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this ! \\nsorry , non-british readers may not be familiar with french and saunders - my apologies . \\nthe pair are british comediennes ( jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in \\\" absolutely fabulous \\\" ) , who did a series of film spoofs a few years back , including alien , the exorcist and misery . \\nneedless to say , amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates ( the resemblance was quite uncanny ! ) , dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder's legs ! \\nbut despite the lingering memory of their sketch , and although i've now seen the film a couple of times now , that \\\" hobbling \\\" scene was no less disturbing ! \\ni'm still left screaming at the telly in revulsion ! \\nthat may be the most memorable scene , but it's certainly not the only worth watching . \\nstephen king , whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality , strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale . \\nit's a nicely crafted psychological horror , which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon ( james caan ) . \\nrescued from a car accident by annie wilkes ( bates ) , who introduces herself as the writer's \\\" number one fan \\\" , he soon becomes her prisoner . \\nboth the script and kathy bates' beautifully masterful performance ( for which she won an oscar ) work arm-in-arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruit-cake ( or is that fruity as a nut-cake ? ) . \\nbates relishes her demanding role , and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece . \\nat times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour , at times she's a rather tragic character , and more often than not she's just damned scary ! \\nthis is basically a very simple tale , but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity . \\nit's an involving , engrossing experience - and considering it's basically a two-hander , mainly set in one locale , it's a remarkable piece of cinema . \\nthere are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences - this one relies solely upon rob reiner's stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan . \\noh , i haven't really mentioned caan yet - he does a good job as the writer who's a prisoner of his own success ( annie is obsessed with him and his books ) . \\nbut , as you no doubt gathered from the above - bates is well and truly the star of the show . \\nalong with the pig , of course ! \\nanyway , the tension is built-up with masterful aplomb , and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense . \\nthere's the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve-shattering lengths to poison her wine . \\nhe succeeds , but . . . she \\nknocks the glass over ! \\ni bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well ! \\nin the immortal words of homer j . simpson - \\\" d'oh ! ! \\\" \\nother nerve-wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house . \\nwe cut to annie in her car - she's on her way home . . . he \\nrealises this and tries to get back to his room . . . cut \\nto the car again , she's getting near . . . will he make it ? \\nok , so these sequences aren't exactly original , nor perhaps unpredictable - but they work ! \\nboy , do they work ! \\nif a film has you on the edge of your couch , biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense , then it's doing something right ! \\nof course , the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned \\\" hobbling \\\" ! \\nannie realises her captive has been out of his room , and she's going to stop him once and for all . \\ncue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer , and . . . i feel ill just thinking about it ! \\nnasty . \\nit all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand , and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho ! \\nand then we're given one of the most ridiculously over-the-top fight scenes i've ever seen . \\nshe gets hit over the head with a typewriter , set on fire , head smashed against the wall - and she just won't die ! \\nsheldon isn't in terribly good shape either . \\nif it weren't so gorey it would almost be laughable . \\nbut it's a terrifically effective film , and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked . \\nmisery is a tight , tense , intense and chillingly entertaining thriller . \\nthe directing is first-rate , and the performances - bates in particular - contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem . \\nwonderful stuff . \\n ? - * - * - * - * - * - * - * - * - for more regularly-updated film and tv reviews , check out my site ! \\nhttp

, adrian brody , jennifer esposito , michael rispoli , bebe neuwirth . \\nrated r . \\nsummer of sam will be remembered as a waste of spike lee's abilities . \\nlee is a great filmmaker , often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with brian depalma and martin scorsese and a storytelling ability comparable to steven spielberg . \\nbut here , he gets himself into a bind . \\nhis latest effort is a case of a director pretending he has something to say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb from his work . \\nthe summer of 1977 was an unusual summer in new york city . \\nit was the hottest summer on record . \\nto boot , new york's first serial killer was on the loose : calling himself the son of sam , david berkowitz killed 9 people in the new york area and frightened the whole city population . \\nso it was understandable that when nyc was hit with a citywide blackout , people went berserk , causing billions of dollars in damage to the city . \\nthe movie's focus is on a group of twenty-somethings during that fateful summer : vinny ( john leguizamo ) , a club-hopping , adultrous hairdresser , his benevolent wife dionna ( mira sorvino , looking young ) , ritchie ( adrian brody ) , a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son of sam suspect , a gang of small time mobsters and a few more minor characters . \\nwe follow them through their roller coaster lives , thrown out of whack even more by the recent killings . \\nvinny and dionna have marital problems because vinny cheats and dionna tries to please him , make him stay faithful to her . \\nritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he has started to become more and more \\\" eccentric , \\\" and has degenerated to the point of dancing in gay night clubs and making porno films with his girlfriend . \\ntensions build and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of son of sam's first murder looms ; the night he promises he will strike again . \\na local gang with too much time on its hands makes a list detailing all of the people that its members think might be suspects . \\nat the top of the list is ritchie . \\nvinny , an unwilling part of the said group , is called upon to set a trap for his friend . \\nas we watch these proceedings , some of which are painfully graphic , the dreaded \\\" so what ? \\\" \\nquestion springs to mind . \\nfrom the way this movie is made , i'd have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something , but as i searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find . \\nlee touches on so much -- the media , the 70's punk scene , the details of the actual killings , as well as the characters' very personal dilemmas -- but he doesn't bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statement . \\nall is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow ; it can be a saving grace for the film to be enjoyable . \\ntoo bad summer of sam doesn't get any help here . \\nfrankly , it's a bore , a redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that doesn't entertain beyond its first half hour . \\nthere is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague . \\nleguizamo's turn as vinnie is annoying and whiny . \\nthe script makes it clear that we're supposed to believe that his character is flawed , but still a good guy . \\nyou'd never guess from his performance . \\nadrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better . \\nsorvino gives a riveting , touching performance in a banal movie ( i'm tempted to think that i liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane ) ; her character is affecting and her emotions true-to-heart . \\nbrody , too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for . \\nsummer of sam has some superficial elements of a good film : it looks great , it has a few notable performances and i suppose it's pretty well directed , in a purely technical way . \\nbut it's also empty , pretentious and boring . \\nlike last year's the thin red line , it's a movie by a director who doesn't know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway . \\n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \\n\",\n          \"in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because , in a year plagued by brothers mcmullen-style , earnestly shallow gen-x angst pictures , it seemed to be actually about something . \\nit angered people , started arguments outside the theater , riled things up . \\nit ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise has been a disappointing year for independent film . \\nhaving endured my share of the hype , i waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein i reside , and then checked in to see what all the fuss was about . \\ndoes men live up to its press ? \\nwell , yes it does . \\nand it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office . \\nfor the uninitiated , newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard , two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment . \\nchad and howard are archetypes , examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business . \\nchad is the blond golden boy , genetically engineered for success , the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder . \\nhoward is chad's boss , but he is weaker of will , the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent . \\nwe first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge . \\nthere chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain : he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office , woo her simultaneously , win her love , and then dump her . \\nthe reason ? \\nboth men have recently been dumped themselves , and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex . \\n \\\" it'll restore a little dignity to our lives , \\\" he says . \\nhoward , helpless against the force of chad's will , agrees to the plan . \\nthey quickly spot their prey in the form of christine ( stacy edwards ) , a fragile deaf woman working as a temp . \\nchad moves in for the kill , flashing his golden boy smile , plying christine with lunch , then flowers , then dinner . \\nhoward follows suit , though his efforts are in contrast ham-handed and desperate . \\nflattered to have the attention of two eligible men , christine dates them both . \\nyou can guess which one she falls for . \\nsoon a tragic lovers' triangle develops : christine loves chad , chad loves himself , and howard loves christine on the grounds that , since she's handicapped and shy , she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him . \\nadult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high , does it ? \\nin chad , writer/director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film-hannibal lector may eat human flesh , but chad is an eater of souls . \\nhis evil is as subtle as a viper's , and as easy as his smile . \\nwe watch in stunned disbelief as he back-stabs coworkers , humiliates his subordinates , and works his deadly venom into christine's heart . \\nhis character would be a joke if he wasn't so chillingly real- all of us have worked with a chad , and some of us may be him . \\nhe's the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness . \\nif one of his co-workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns , he had best have his escape route clearly in mind . \\npolitics is his game , and the modern cubicle-filled office is his playground . \\nmen wears the guise of a black comedy , but it functions best as allegory . \\nthe most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company , then forces him to prove it in a manner i won't describe . \\nthe scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril . \\ncould it happen in the real world ? \\nprobably not . \\ntaken as allegory , however , it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society . \\nmaybe it's just the english major in me , but chad , in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard , can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism , of greed without conscience . \\nthe entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism- only the strong will survive . \\nthe marvel of labute's multi-layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way . \\nbut does the film work as entertainment ? \\nits darned funny in spots , particularly in the men's room scenes , which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions . \\nit works less well as drama , since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers . \\nstacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine , and succeeds in making us care for her , but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her . \\nlikewise , chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions . \\nby the end of the film you'll feel as if you've met a genuine monster in chad ; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film . \\ncertainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed . \\nbut the picture is often mesmerizing , and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship , which makes it well worth your time . \\nlike all good films , it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world . \\nwhile watching chad in his moment of triumph , i couldn't help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold , merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs . \\nthere may be a little bit of chad in all of us , but some of us have taken chad-ness to the level of art . \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

\\nnot really . \\nthe sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half-way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still didn't the make the film all that more entertaining . \\ni guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is \\\" into it \\\" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding . \\ni mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! ! \\nokay , we get it . . . there \\nare people chasing her and we don't know who they are . \\ndo we really need to see it over and over again ?
